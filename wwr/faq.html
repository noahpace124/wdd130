                    <p><b>Q: What is white water rafting?</b><br>
                        A: White water rafting is an adventurous activity where participants navigate a river in an inflatable raft. The river's current and rapids provide thrilling challenges, making it a popular outdoor sport.</p>
                        
                        <p><b>Q: Do I need prior experience to go white water rafting?</b><br>
                        A: No prior experience is necessary! Our guides will provide safety instructions and basic paddling techniques before the trip.</p>
                        
                        <p><b>Q: What should I wear for a rafting trip?</b><br>
                        A: Wear quick-drying clothing, such as swimsuits, synthetic t-shirts, and shorts. Avoid cotton as it retains water. We also recommend secure footwear like water shoes or sports sandals. Helmets and life jackets will be provided.</p>

                        <p><b>Q: Is white water rafting safe?</b><br>
                        A: Safety is our top priority. Our trained guides are certified in water safety and first aid, and all participants are equipped with proper safety gear. While there is an element of risk in any adventure activity, we take every precaution to minimize it.</p>
                        
                        <p><b>Q: Can children participate in white water rafting?</b><br>
                        A: Yes, children can join, but there are age and weight requirements depending on the river's difficulty level. We offer family-friendly rafting trips suitable for beginners.</p>
                        
                        <p><b>Q: What are the different difficulty levels of rafting trips?</b><br>
                        A: Rafting trips are categorized from Class I (easy, calm waters) to Class V (challenging, with intense rapids). Our team can help you choose the right level based on your experience and comfort.</p>
                        
                        <p><b>Q: How long does a rafting trip usually last?</b><br>

                        A: While swimming skills are not mandatory, itâ€™s recommended. Life jackets will keep you afloat, and our guides are trained to assist in case of an emergency.</p>

                        <p><b>Q: Can I bring a camera or phone on the trip?</b><br>
                        A: You can bring a waterproof camera or use a waterproof case for your phone. However, we recommend leaving expensive equipment behind as there's always a risk of it getting wet or lost.</p>
